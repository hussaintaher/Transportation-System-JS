# what is the the idea ?
    Classes Tree:
        1. Vehicle class
            A. Car subclass
            B. Airplain subclass
        2. Employee class
            A. Pilot subclass
            B. Driver subclass
    Idea:
        Car and Airplain subclasses inherts properties from vehicle class.
        Pilot and Driver subclasses inherts properties from Employee class.
        I create 3 instances from Car subclass and 2 from Airplain subclass.
        I create 1 instance from Pilot subclass and 1 from Driver subclass.
        I create function that receives two parameters, one is employee id, 
        second is vehicle id to reserve on vehicle for one employee.
        Finally, I print all reserved vehicles
